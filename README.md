In this project I have created a customized spotify Dashboard for analyzing music

For this I have used an add on named Bravo which helps in arranging the Date datatype very easily and embedd it into the data seamlessly

The cover images for tracks in the dataset were imported via web through HTML add-on.

For the customized Heatmap,I used Deneb Add-on which is Basically an JSON based custom visual.
