In this project I have created a customized spotify Dashboard for analyzing music

For this I have 

-Utilized HTML scripting and D3.js (Deneb library) to create a dynamic and visually appealing dashboard.

-Implemented advanced data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to enhance data quality and accuracy.

-Incorporated rich visuals and innovative features:

-Integrated song pictures into the dashboard for a visually immersive experience.

-Employed advanced DAX commands for robust data analysis, contributing to a comprehensive and insightful Spotify data visualization tool.
